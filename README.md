### Inspiration
We wanted to make an webapp from scratch 

### What it does
Kitchen Ingredients filter out recipes based on what ingredients that you add

### How we built it
We started by connecting the database Firebase with HTML and CSS. Javascript is used to make sure there are some functions.

### Challenges we ran into
We spent the majority of our time interfacing

This was the first major project we have done and we could have done more

There were disagreements based on what languages to use

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wrote code separately and it worked when we connected everything together. We also utilized many different disciplines like databases, frontend, and backend

### What we learned
how to communicate between the frontend and database
how to start a project from scratch
how an agile based development works
how to learn from each other in seperate tasks

### What's next for Kitchen Ingredients
Allow more recipes to be uploaded
Make the frontend look better
Filter recipes based on ingredients
Use the database scalability


### Built With
HTML
CSS
Firebase
